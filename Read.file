🔮 Tomorrow Temperature Prediction

The model predicts temperature for future dates using estimated irradiance and time inputs.
Example:

Predicted temperature for tomorrow at 12:00 = 22.98 °C

🎓 Conclusion

The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy (97.86%) with a low prediction error (0.62 °C), demonstrating that solar irradiance combined with temporal features is highly effective for temperature prediction.
The interactive dashboard provides clear visualization and practical forecasting capability.

🚀 Future Scope

Integrate real-time weather APIs

Add humidity and wind speed features

Deploy dashboard as a web application

Extend to multi-day forecasting
